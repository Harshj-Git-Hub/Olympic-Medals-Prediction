# Project Overview

Here in this Linear Regession based Machine Learning project, we'll use data from historical Olympic games and will try to predict how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data.


# Machine learning project steps

**Project Steps**

1. Form a hypothesis.
2. Find and explore the data.
3. (If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.
4. Clean the data for ML.
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split your data.
7. Train a model.
